# rxjs-label-makerRxJS Label Maker Example.RxJs is used to handle all events from 122 form inputs; no event listeners.The tabbed responsive web page produces "fake" mailing labels upon valid input.All code is functional, with no ifs, fors, nor while loops; excepting testing code.There are snapshot tests which run inside iFrames.To fail all medium-sized snapshot tests, set zoom to 125% with Edge browser. Firefox, Chrome, and Edge browsers pass all tests as long as zoomed is 100%.Try [RxJS Label Maker online](https://steenhansen.github.io/rxjs-label-maker/), Requires ES6.![visual explanation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/steenhansen/rxjs-label-maker/master/lib/can_nz_usa.png)
